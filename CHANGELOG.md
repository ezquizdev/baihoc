### chore: make db init resilient
- Wrapped enum creation in guards and added `DB_RESET=true` option to drop/recreate the schema when running `db:init` (dev only). Documented in README/env example.

### feat: backend auth services and routes
- Added auth services for email registration/login, email verification, password reset, Google OAuth upsert + profile completion, and transactional emails. New Next.js API routes under `/api/auth/**`. Updated env and schema to support OAuth fields.

### feat: add Brevo email service and test
- Implemented Brevo-based transactional email helper with sender env vars, added `vitest` setup, and created `npm run test:email` to send a verification email to `huytrinhm@gmail.com`.

### fix: ensure citext extension
- Updated `db/schema.sql` to enable the `citext` extension before creating tables so Supabase init succeeds.

### chore: simplify db init flow
- Removed automatic predev DB init; added `pg`/`dotenv` dependencies and clarified manual `npm run db:init` after setting `DATABASE_URL`. Devs can drop and re-init DB if schema changes.

### chore: auto-init database on dev start
- Added `db/schema.sql`, a `scripts/db/init.js` bootstrap, and `npm run db:init` hooked into `predev` to auto-create tables when a `DATABASE_URL` is provided. Updated docs/env example accordingly.

### docs: remove agent references from README
- Reworded the README documentation section so it speaks only to human contributors and doesn’t mention internal agent resources.

### chore: keep agent guide at root
- Restored `AGENTS.md` to the repository root (while keeping it git-ignored) so the latest instructions are easy to find locally.

### chore: move docs to agent resources
- Moved `AGENTS.md`, `arch.md`, and `ucspec.md` into the git-ignored `/agent-resources` folder and refreshed the public README to focus on human contributors.

### chore: document agent resources and changelog
- Added `/agent-resources` guidance to AGENTS.md, ensured the directory stays git-ignored, and introduced `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking commits.

### chore: remove template assets and fonts
- Removed create-next-app imagery and favicon, switched to system font stacks, and set BaiHoc-branded landing placeholder.

### chore: scaffold BaiHoc architecture
- Documented architecture expectations, added env/config/logging scaffolding, and initialized application directories per Nest-style layering.
